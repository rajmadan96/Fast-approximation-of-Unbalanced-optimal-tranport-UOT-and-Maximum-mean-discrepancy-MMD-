# Fast-approximation-of-Unbalanced-optimal-transport-UOT-and-Maximum-mean-discrepancy-MMD
This contribution presents significant computational accelerations to prominent schemes, which enable the comparison of measures, even with varying masses. 
Concisely, we employ nonequispaced fast Fourier transform to accelerate the radial kernel convolution in unbalanced optimal transport approximation, building on the Sinkhorn algorithm.
Accelerated schemes are presented as well for the maximum mean discrepancies involving kernels based on distances.
By employing nonequispaced fast Fourier transform, our approaches significantly reduce the arithmetic operations to compute the distances from $ùìû(n¬≤)$ to $ùìû(n \log n)$, which enables access to large and high-dimensional data sets.
